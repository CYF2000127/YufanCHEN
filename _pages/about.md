About me
======
I'm now a first year Ph.D student from Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, supervised by Prof.Hanyu GAO and Prof.Hao CHEN. 

I received my B.Eng in Information Engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and M.Sc in Electronic Engineering in HKUST. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests include deep learning approach based medical imaging, bio and cheminformatics. Recently I am working on LLM in cheminformatics.
